# unicrypt

Simply, securely, and privately encrypt text or the contents of a file. You can use Unicrypt for many things, such as; to encrypt & decrypt the contents of an email, to encrypt the seed phrase to your cryptocurrency wallet, to encrypt a self-note, or SMS messages.

As required by the software license, stated below are the changes we have made to this open source software:
- Update Styling
- Update Wording
- Integrate into swivro.net/unicrypt.html (license & software info can been on the FAQ. the code is the same, but it may have a different appearence as swivro.net uses the bootstrap/mobirise framework, which alters the design of some html elements.)
- Censor/hide passphrase & seed phrase when typed into input
- Use Swivro CDN instead of Cloudflare CDN for JS files (cryptojs)
